# Vaccination Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, "Vaccination Data Analysis," involves creating a relational database from scratch to store and analyze global vaccination data. The database includes tables for locations, vaccinations, vaccine manufacturing, age groups, and US states, designed to manage and analyze vaccination data effectively.

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed to capture detailed information about vaccination data, including:

1. **Location**: Information about the country, vaccine names, and sources.
2. **Vaccination**: Daily vaccination data for each country.
3. **Vaccine_Manufacture**: Details about the vaccines manufactured and used in different countries.
4. **Age_Group**: Vaccination data categorized by age groups.
5. **US_State**: Vaccination data for different states in the USA.
